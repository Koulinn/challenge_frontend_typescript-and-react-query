- Run the command npm i or yarn install 

- Run the command npm start or yarn start

## Comments

-   Focused on folder structure and Typescript

-   If a request to vulnerabilities/:vulnerability_ID happened I would create a route with a parameter

-   This is my first time using react-query, found it extremely powerful with retries, caching, error handlings other useful features that are available.

-   Although I didn't implemented, I would consider pagination when there are too many items to be displayed (backend or front-end), the Json provided shows the backend pagination is already provided.

-   I spent around of 8h most of my time on Typescript, react-query, project-structure, unit tests (on this order).

-   In terms of CSS, normally I use styled-components or SASS. Instead of the componentName.css I used on this project. In projects that I start like to normalize the CSS to avoid "surprises".

-   Project structure: usually I like the atomic design pattern due to my affinity with UX design and Figma.

-   I like to separate UI, logic and styling layers. So they don't mix, to keep each bit with its own responsibility.

This is a small proof of concept project to upskill and help a colleague of mine.
